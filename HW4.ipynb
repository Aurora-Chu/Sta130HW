    "Hey, imagine you have a group of, say, your friends' weights, but you've only measured a few of them. Bootstrapping is like playing a game. Its main purpose is to help us get more information from this small sample, especially about some characteristics of the whole group, such as the average weight. In this way, we can obtain more reliable statistical information, such as the confidence level and confidence intervals of the estimates, or even the level of confidence we have in the results.Suppose you think the average weight of your friends is 70kg, but you only have a sample of size n, say 6 people. First, draw a random sample from your 6 friends, say by substitution. That is, you are allowed to sample the same person's weight multiple times. This is like making a larger sample out of the sample you already have. For each sample, calculate the average height of that small sample. Repeat this process, say doing it 1,000 times, and you'll end up with 1,000 values for the average weight. See what these 1000 average values look like. You'll notice that they fluctuate within a certain range, and that range gives you some sense of the average weight. You can calculate the percentile of these averages to find something like a 95% confidence interval. Finally, you can then see if your guess falls within that confidence interval. If it does, then your guess is probably plausible; if it doesn't, then it's probably time to reconsider."
