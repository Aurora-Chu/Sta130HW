    "B.In a statistical test, the p-value is a probability that expresses how strong the evidence is against the null hypothesis. Assuming the null hypothesis is true, it shows the probability of getting a test result that is at least as severe as the observed result. A little p-value (typically less than 0.05) means that there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis, which means it is rejected; on the other hand, a big p-value means that there is weak evidence and the null hypothesis will not be rejected. Nevertheless, p-values do not quantify the importance or effect size of the findings on their own."

For instance, if we gather information from a sample, we compute values like as the sample mean (xÀâ). All we actually need to know, though, is the population mean Œº. The purpose of hypothesis testing is to determine if our sample supports the possibility that the population value (such as Œº0) may differ from what is observed in the sample.Put simply, the objective is to draw conclusions about the population as a whole, not just the sample, even if we deal with samples."
